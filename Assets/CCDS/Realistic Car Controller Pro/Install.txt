Builtin render pipeline no longer supported by RCCP for Unity 6 versions. 

Imported dailog will welcome you before importing RCCP.

Import the right version to your project. Don't import the incorrect one, you won't be able to undo this action.

Be sure your project has proper render pipeline configuration before using RCCP. URP has simple setup, but HDRP is much more complicated. 

Once the import is done, check the console if you are having any errors. You can safely ignore warning messages about missing decal renderers and poly counts on some colliders.
